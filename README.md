# DLIScious


Scripts for parsing DLIS V2 files (http://w3.energistics.org/RP66/V2/Toc/main.html). Based on TotalDepth (https://github.com/paulross/TotalDepth).
It is not complete and need lots of adjusts (it not parses IFLRs yet) but can parse almost all EFLRs.

Due to some problems with encoding at some files I tested I made some changes at the TotalDepth's original file RepCode.py.
